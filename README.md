## Ev Market Segmentation: Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains code for data analysis and visualization using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Gower. The code is designed to analyze different datasets related to cars, electric vehicles, and vehicle registrations.

### Data Analysis

The data analysis and visualization code are divided into different sections, each focusing on a specific dataset:

1. Car Info 1: Analysis of car information data, including MPG, Cylinders, Displacement, Horsepower, Weight, Acceleration, and Origin. Various data visualization techniques, such as histograms and scatter plots, are used to explore relationships between variables.

2. Car Info 2: This section analyzes data related to electric vehicles, including battery capacity, acceleration, top speed, range, and price. Bar plots and scatter plots are used to visualize the data.

3. Registration: Data analysis of vehicle registration numbers based on different categories. Bar plots are used to visualize the total registered vehicles in different states.

4. Total EV to Non-EV: This section compares the total number of electric vehicles to non-electric vehicles in different states using bar plots and pie charts.

5. DBSCAN Clustering: The code performs DBSCAN clustering on the car information dataset to identify groups of similar cars. It uses the Gower distance metric to measure similarity between cars and dendrogram visualization to help determine the optimal number of clusters.

### Instructions

To run the code, you need to have Python and the required libraries installed. Clone this repository to your local machine and run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the analysis code.

Feel free to modify the code and datasets to perform your data analysis and visualization tasks.

Please note that some plots may require an active internet connection to display interactive visualizations using Plotly. If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out to the repository's owner.
